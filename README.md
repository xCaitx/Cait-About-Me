# Ticket #0002 - Portfolio Page - Cait Rose
 
I have prepared a portfolio of my work to date, with changes to be made as the bootcamp course progresses, to outline samples of my work which meets the critera for potential employers who may look to hire me.

## Installation

* I first started by creating a colour pallet and setting this as a root element for my styling sheet.

* Created the Header with links to scroll to sections of my page.

* Added a photo that best represents me at this time with a short about me.

* Created a sidebar for "my work" with my portfolio gallery next to this and a photo with a link to my deloyed job for our first homework, no other photos include links at this stage.

* Contact me section at the bottom of the page. In future I hope to link this to a seperate page entirely.
